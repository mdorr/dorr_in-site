Welcome to my website! My name is Maurice, and I am a software developer living in New Jersey. You can find more information about me <a href="/about.html">here</a>. I also own an indie game studio, which you can find <a href="https://dorrin.tech">here</a>.

This site is where I capture personal observations and thoughts regarding technology, cooking, and everything else that comes to mind.

So, thanks for stopping by - enjoy your stay!
