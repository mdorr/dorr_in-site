How many switches do you have in your house? The light switches come to mind - at least one per room, a few extra for the hallway and the outside, so maybe a dozen or two. Add your other electric devices - desk lamps, microwave, hair dryer, television, you get the idea. Add all those switches up, and - unless your are an electrical engineer or live in a huge house - I'd guess you'd be around a hundred.

However, we are still missing a lot of switches. And I am talking, of course, about the [Transistors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) that make up the processors and other integrated circuits in your phones and computers.

On a very basic level, a transistor works as an electronic switch: By applying a current, we open or close a circuit. In reality, it is a bit more than that, since a transistor can also work as an amplifier. But still, all things considered, it kinda works like a switch. And combining all these switches within an integrated circuit such as a CPU physically enables computation.

I like to say that computers really are glorified [abacuses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus): They basically just add and subtract numbers, but they can do it really, *really* fast. I am simplifying this quite a lot, but at the core of each processor is a really simple [Instruction set](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/instset.htm), which is mostly used to execute mathematical calculations. 

Well, where do the switches come in? 

Computers uses [binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) to represent  data. This is done for technical reasons: A circuit can either be closed, or open - on, or off. So it makes sense to utilize the binary system with the numbers 1 and 0 to map to the underlying mechanism. And now we can do math with these switches. Somebody made a [Marble adding machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcDshWmhF4A) which shows how the concept works. 

This marble machine has six switches and can add numbers up to 63. A modern CPU is capable of much more than that; hence, it has a staggering amount of transistors. I am writing this on a not quite current tablet. The [CPU contains 3.3 billion transistors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A10). 3,300,000,000 tiny switches. And this is in a small handheld device.

Globally, it is thought that about [thirteen billion trillion have been made so far](https://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/13-sextillion-counting-the-long-winding-road-to-the-most-frequently-manufactured-human-artifact-in-history/). That's 13,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tiny switches. And even though [Moore's law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) of doubling the transistor count on a given chip area will probably reach it's limits soon, the amount of transistors made will continue to rise - after all, we can just [make the chips larger](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-chip-cerebras.html)!

Modern computers are near silent, which is a blessing. But sometimes I wonder how it would sound to hear all those the tiny clickety-clack of all those happily calculating tiny switches.
